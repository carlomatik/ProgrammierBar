# ProgrammierBar
this is a repository for webdocs 20/21 assignement 2, organized by Alexander Müller and Carlo Bueckert (group 9)

## business description
The programmierbar is a local bar which mostly focuses on students.
It also offers a wide variety of events focused on students that are interested in computer science.
Example given the bar regulary hosts events such as LAN-parties and hackathons.
The owner regulary hosts such events himself, but also offers his bar as a location for others to host their events.
He also sells a small collection of merchandise at his store.
Since photography is a huge hobby of his, he takes fotos of whats happening at events or even at a normal evenings.

## website title, domain and purpose
Naturally, the website for the ProgrammierBar will be called programmierbar too.

As a fitting and available domain ".beer" is the desired choice.

The purpose of the whole website is to boost the online presence of the ProgrammierBar and the opportunity for potential guests and hosts alike to gain awareness of the ProgrammierBar and it's offers.
Because of that the owner wishes to establish a website where potential guests can see the offered drinks, a timetable of future events and a gallery of past events.
These past events are to be shown as photos, videos, or potential documents solving past hackathons.
Potential hosts for hackathons, LAN-parties and other events can submit their interest via this website as well.

## look and feel
The website should look minimalistic with focus on the important parts.
Like the bar itself the main colour of the website should be black.
Text and logos are desired to be white with an orange accent colour, like beer.
When hovering over an element which changes webpages, a hyperlink, or anything else to that matter the element is supposed to change colours, namely that the font gets black and the elements box tourns white.
Other than that there are no additional colours desired, to keep the website minimal.

To that matter the amount of decorative elements is to be kept as minimal as possible, including - at best only - the logo and boxes / lines to put emphasis on certain elements.

The whole website is visioned to consist of only one basic font, e.g. arial, with the only stilistic variations being the font being italic, bold or normal and a variaty of font sizes.

In terms of feels the whole website should feel like a single layout, which only changes content depending on the webpage thats currently visited.
The transition between these webpages is thought to be fast and not noticable to the user, so no visual indication is desired.
Every content should be accessible from every device, so the elements need to be resizable depending on the screen dimensions.
If the webpage demands a scrolling functionality, the scrolling needs to be visually without delay, so it needs to be smooth.

## XML/SVG/audio/video
Sample XML at "/dataDec-8-2020.xml"  

The branding/logo of the ProgrammierBar is black and white, minimilastic and consists of a glass of beer next to a laptop schematic.
It is desired that this logo will be modelled as a SVG and is always visible on the top left of the website.  

Also the owner of the bar wishes to present his bar with a quick video on his about webpage.
